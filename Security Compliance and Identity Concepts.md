# Describe security and compliance concepts
## Describe the shared responsibility model
Cloud security is a shared responsibility. This model defines the duties of customers and cloud service providers (CSPs) in ensuring the cloud environment is secure.

In **all** cloud deployment types, you own the data and identities.
- You are responsible for protecting the security of any data, identities, and on-prem resources.
- You are also responsible for the cloud components you control, which will vary depending on the service type. 

The following responsibilities are **always** the customer's responsibility:
- Data
- Endpoints/devices
- Accounts
- Access management

## Describe defense in depth

## Describe the Zero-Trust model
Zero Trust is a security strategy.

- Verify explicitly: Always authenticate & authorize based on all available data points.
- Use least privilege: Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection.
- Assume breach: Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.

With ZT, we move away from trust-by-default to trust-by-exception.
